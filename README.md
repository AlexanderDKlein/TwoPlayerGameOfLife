# TwoPlayerGameOfLife
This is a project assigned to me in my System Level Programming and Utilities class. Its function is to run John Conway's Game of Life in two player mode for a specified number of rounds, by inputting the size of the grid, and specifying which cells belong to player 1, which belong to player 2, and which are dead cells.
